# Spam Detection Analysis Report
## How My Model Learns
### Features I Used
1. **Word Count**: Because spam emails might have either one or 2 words or super long paragraphs. This helps locate unusual models
2. **Exclamation Marks**: To get someone's attention or make it seem very important
3. **Money Words**: These words lure people with financial incentives
4. **ALL CAPS**: They tend to feel aggresive and attention grabbing
## Training Results
- Training Accuracy: 96%
- Testing Accuracy: 80%?
### What This Means
That the model performs well and that it keeps a high accuracy. This means that the model learned general patterns that scammers use.
## Preventing Overfitting
Overfitting was prevented by focusin on simple features. This helps the tool generalize patterns without memorizing training sets. 
## Real-World Application
If this was used by Gmail:
- Strengths: it is fast, good at catching simple and obvious scam messages, simple an easy to understand.
- Weaknesses: could flag actual emails that show excitement, only good for simple scam emails and might miss sophisticated spam.
- Improvements needed: use a larger training data to catch more types of scams, add continuous learning models so the software advances. 
## What I Learned
I learned that learning models use training tools to identify patterns. I learned about overfitting and how to try to avoid, even in simple program. How computers now use data to make decisions instead of it being hard coded.
